#Array 

    **Quick summary:** a collection that stores elements in order and looks them up by index.
    -Also known as: fixed array, static array.

### Important facts:
    -Stores elements sequentially, one after another.
    -Each array element has an index. Zero-based indexing is used most often: the first index is 0, the second is 1, and so on.
    -Is created with a fixed size. Increasing or decreasing the size of an array is impossible.
    -Can be one-dimensional (linear) or multi-dimensional.
    -Allocates contiguous memory space for all its elements.

### Pros:
    -Ensures constant time access by index.
    -Constant time append (insertion at the end of an array).

### Cons:
    -Fixed size that can't be changed.
    -Search, insertion and deletion are O(n). After insertion or deletion, all subsequent elements are moved one index further.
    -Can be memory intensive when capacity is underused.

### Notable uses:
    -The String data type that represents text is implemented in programming languages as an array that consists of a     -sequence of characters plus a terminating character.

### Time complexity (worst case):
    Access: O(1)
    Search: O(n)
    Insertion: O(n) (append: O(1))
    Deletion: O(n)
# Dynamic array

      **Quick summary:** an array that can resize itself.
      Also known as: array list, list, growable array, resizable array, mutable array, dynamic table.

### Important facts:
      -Same as array in most regards: stores elements sequentially, uses numeric indexing, allocates contiguous memory space.
      -Expands as you add more elements. Doesn't require setting initial capacity.
      -When it exhausts capacity, a dynamic array allocates a new contiguous memory space that is double the previous capacity, and copies all values to the new location.
      -Time complexity is the same as for a fixed array except for worst-case appends: when capacity needs to be doubled, append is O(n). However, the average append is still O(1).

### Pros:
   -Variable size. A dynamic array expands as needed.
   -Constant time access.

### Cons:
   -Slow worst-case appends: O(n). Average appends: O(1).
   -Insertion and deletion are still slow because subsequent elements must be moved a single index further. 
   -Worst-case (insertion into/deletion from the first index, a.k.a. prepending) for both is O(n).

### Time complexity (worst case): 
      Access: O(1)
      Search: O(n)
      Insertion: O(n) (append: O(n))
      Deletion: O(n)
