# History of algorithms:

        Ancient Origins:
        -Early civilizations (Egypt, Babylon, Greece, China) developed problem-solving methods.
        
        Euclidean Algorithm (circa 300 BCE):
        -Euclid devised an algorithm to find the greatest common divisor.
        
        Al-Khwarizmi and Algebra (circa 825 CE):
        -Al-Khwarizmi introduced algebra and systematic problem-solving methods.
        -The term "algorithm" originates from Al-Khwarizmi's name.
        
        Renaissance and Early Modern Period:
        -European mathematicians (e.g., Fibonacci) further advanced algorithms and introduced new mathematical techniques.
        
        19th and 20th Centuries:
        -Development of modern computing machines and formalized computational methods.
        -Contributions from Gauss, Lovelace, Turing, among others.
        
        Contemporary Era:
        -Surge in algorithmic research and development.
        -Algorithms power various fields including computer programming, cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.
