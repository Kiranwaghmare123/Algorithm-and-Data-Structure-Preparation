## Algorithms:
    Definition: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or instructions for solving a problem, usually expressed as a sequence of well-defined computational steps.
    Properties:
    Correctness: An algorithm should produce the correct output for every valid input.
    Efficiency: Algorithms should be designed to execute with reasonable time and space complexity.

# Types of Algorithms:
    Sorting Algorithms: Arrange elements of a list in a particular order (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).
    Searching Algorithms: Find the location of an element in a data structure (e.g., linear search, binary search).
    Graph Algorithms: Solve problems on graphs, such as shortest path, minimum spanning tree, etc. (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm, BFS, DFS).
    Dynamic Programming: Break down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solve each subproblem just once (e.g., Fibonacci series).
    Greedy Algorithms: Make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment (e.g., Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree).
    Backtracking Algorithms: Enumerate all possible solutions, recursively exploring each branch of the search space (e.g., N-Queens problem).

# Analysis:
    Time Complexity: Measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the length of the input.
    Space Complexity: Measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input.

# Data Structures:
    Definition: Data structures are collections of data organized in a particular way to facilitate efficient manipulation and storage.
    
    ### Types of Data Structures:
    
        Arrays: A collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.
        Linked Lists: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference (link) to the next node.
        Stacks: A collection of elements with two main operations: push (add) and pop (remove), following Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
        Queues: A collection of elements with two main operations: enqueue (add) and dequeue (remove), following First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
        Trees: Hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges, with a single root node and no cycles.
        Graphs: Non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect these nodes.
        Hash Tables: Data structures that store key-value pairs and provide efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

# Operations:
    Traversal: Process of visiting all the nodes of a data structure in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order for trees).
    Insertion: Adding a new element to the data structure.
    Deletion: Removing an existing element from the data structure.
    Search: Finding a specific element in the data structure.
